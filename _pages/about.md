Hello, my name is Tianxiang Chen, and I am currently a final-year PhD student at Schools of Cyber Space and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), under the supervision of Prof. [Nenghai Yu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7620QAMAAAAJ&hl=en). Prior to this, I obtained my Bachelor's degree from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Yingcai Honors College. My major was in Mathematics, Physics, and Fundamental Sciences. My current research interests lie in the areas of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), Medical AI, and small target detection.

I have published several first-author and corresponding-author papers in top-tier journals and conferences, including TMI, TCSVT, TGRS, Scientific Data, AAAI, EMNLP, IJCAI, and ACM MM. These publications reflect my commitment to advancing the state-of-the-art in these fields. During my PhD, I had the opportunity to complete a long-term internship at Alibaba Cloud, where I was jointly supervised by [Jieping Ye](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=T9AzhwcAAAAJ&hl=en) (VP of Alibaba Cloud, IEEE Fellow) and [Le Lu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kZn0f6gAAAAJ&hl=en) (IEEE Fellow, MICCAI Board Member). This experience provided me with valuable insights into the practical applications of AI and deepened my understanding of the industry's needs.
